On a wonderful day like today, I defy any cloud to appear in the sky
Dare any raindrop to plop in my eye, on a wonderful day like today

On a wonderful morning like this, when the sun is as big as a yellow balloon
Even the sparrows are singing in tune, on a wonderful day like today

On a morning like this I can kiss everybody, so full of love and good will
Let me say furthermore I'd adore everybody, to come and dine, the pleasures mine and I will pay the bill

May I take this occasion to say, that the whole human race should go down on its knees
Show that we're grateful for mornings like these, on a lovely day like today

I dare any raindrop to plop in my eye, on a wonderful day like today

Even the sparrows are singing in tune, on a wonderful day like today

On a morning like this I can kiss everybody, so full of love and good will
Let me say furthermore I'd adore everybody to come and dine, the pleasure's mine...

May I take this occasion to say, that the whole human race should go down on its knees
Show that we're grateful for mornings like these, cuz the worlds in a wonderful way
On a beautiful day like today!
